So it should be near Delhi only now we can eliminate other options from the google image and get it as Belvede Towers

now since we couldnt see any billboard we searched all the concerts that were held on 26 october and tried all the possible answers including 
`nite{Zomato,Diljit_Dosanjh,Jawaharlal_Nehru_Stadium}`
`nite{Zomato,Guly_Gang,Nesco}`
we googled multidimensinal bilboard we also found that vivo and hyundai could be the host but we couldnt find any hosted by vivo we did find one hosted by hyundai 

but we still couldnt get the flag . 

Literally my teammate :
