## Solution 
using google image intially provided a lot of results so looking closely we 
Zooming in the image we see a graffiti art 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ac627f1-3f7b-434a-8e09-837820422144)

It says Byska prolly the artist , googling byska

So it should be near Delhi only now we can eliminate other options from the google image and get it as Belvede Towers 
using google street view

now since we couldnt see any billboard we searched all the concerts that were held on 26 october and tried all the possible answers including 
`nite{Zomato,Diljit_Dosanjh,Jawaharlal_Nehru_Stadium}`
`nite{Zomato,Guly_Gang,Nesco}`
we googled multidimensinal bilboard we also found that vivo and hyundai could be the host but we couldnt find any hosted by vivo we did find one hosted by hyundai 

but we still couldnt get the flag . 

Literally my teammate :

the real flag was just the same without the city in the venue part so we were right there but hardluck LOL

## Attempt

The scheme.pdf provided is basically a circuit diagram of various component of the electric lock.
Googling each component name to get what type of component it is much like : 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c277339-3db6-4289-8b0f-3337dcf05534)

and trying to draw a simplified circuit diagram in which only the both the inputs of each component is taken care about and unnecessary wires are removed

since my knowledge on eletrconics is -1 the 16 digit number obtained isnt the flag.

## Attempt 
Seemed like a simple promblem at first where we have to assume things and could be solved manually so i just tried that without googling much about it

all the things done in the above solution was wrong from my understanding now and hence couldnt solve the promblem.

## Attempt
The challenge had a image 
![freakada_3301_message](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37f319bd-300f-45a9-a09d-81596d86ce62)

since its an image I tried hex analysis and general image analysis . 
Using exiftool analysis i found the metadata to have a encrpted msg 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58cb0b05-42b4-4aa1-b2da-d8ff32975953)

Analysing the msg with an online tool 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/194b186f-a7a2-4e2c-99bd-d24f3f43b80a)

solving it with the suggested cipher the msg becomes 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c4aaafa-b15e-4a1a-bf57-ad33a796992f)

going to the suggested url showed an error so i tried again to get https://bit.ly/freakestein0 
going the the site gave us another image 

![ducky](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83312333-495d-433f-b2c2-158d8e14c5e4)

performing image analysis on it with exiftool and hex editor the hex editor revealed a github link 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cac35b7-2ad7-407b-b542-b932f63f9500)

going to the github link 
reveled this :

the second image felt like the a part of flag but i couldnt decipher the intial two messages  

## Print the gifts 
Run all type of exiftool analysis on the files in the zip folder but couldnt figure it out, since santa was giving gifts and it was multiple gifts could be asked thought to do bufferoverflow .

Couldnt make any progress / was lost in all other challenge :((

## Flight Risk 
Felt like cheat engine would do but the game would end before i could find the address of the healtbar. .dll file wouldnt open in unity and couldnt find a way to check the code to change the missle from hitting . 

## For the others i was mostly lost / couldnt understand what actually was going on. I thought i could have been able to solve forensics or Web but didnt happen.
